## by Yazeed Alsulayhim


## Dataset

>This data set contains 113,937 loans with 81 variables on each loan, including loan amount, borrower rate (or interest rate), current loan status, borrower income, and many others. In my analysis I used 23 out of the 81 variables.


## Summary of Findings

> After conducting the analysis I found that:
1.  having a job that pays well will difenatly decrease the apr.
2.  owing a home will decrease the apr.
3.  Living in specific states has a significant effect on the apr score
4.  One's persoal financial history is curical when deciding the apr% (Credit History)
5.  A way for people with bad occupations to stand out in have a low apr is to own a house in states known for having low apr precentages such as [Iowa, Maine, Washington, D.C.]
6.  To have a low prosper score you must be careful with you credit utilization ration. also a low number of delequint accounts would lead to a much higher prosper score.
